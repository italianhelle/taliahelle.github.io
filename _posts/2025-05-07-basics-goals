description: 🎯 Goal Setting: What Are You **Really Trying to Do?

After more than a decade in marketing across semiconductors, SaaS, and gaming, I’ve learned that most marketing chaos starts with fuzzy goals. We’re often so eager to launch the campaign, the feature, the shiny product video, that we forget to ask: *What are we really trying to do here?*

It sounds simple. But "increase engagement," "drive awareness," and "make it go viral" aren't goals, they're just _vibes_. And while I love a good vibe, they won't hold up in your Quarterly Busniess Reviews.

Let’s see what if this helps.

## :arrow: Start With One Sharp Arrow, Not a Quiver of Maybes

When I launched GitHub Projects into General Availability, we weren’t just trying to “make some noise.” We were trying to **increase new users by 2.5% week over week for one month**. That goal gave us a crystal-clear focus, a way to prioritize tactics, and a baseline to optimize against. And it worked! We saw consistent growth and could directly tie our efforts to that benchmark.

Similarly, back in my *Magic: The Gathering* days, clarity was key. Were we aiming to grow collector product sales, bring lapsed players back into stores, or expand into a new retail channel? Each objective required a different strategy, a different creative angle, and a different way to measure success. It all starts with asking the right question: *What are we really trying to do?*

## :whistle: Let AI Be Your Strategy Coach (No Whistle Required)

These days, I use AI as a thinking partner when shaping campaign goals. Tools like ChatGPT or Claude can challenge vagueness, help structure SMART goals, or suggest ways to segment your target audience more effectively.

If you're working in HubSpot, try the [Campaign Assistant](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/campaign-assistant) — it can suggest goal-aligned content formats and even pre-draft landing pages based on your inputs.

In Marketo, try out [Predictive Content](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/predictive-content/predictive-content-overview.html) to recommend content based on audience engagement trends, helping you align your goals with actual user behavior.

## :eyes: Look Sideways, Not Just Forward

Take a peek at how others set their goals. Don't get stuck in an echo chamber.

- **[Notion](https://notion.notion.site/Product-roadmap-c5e8829bb9644dd08c576452ee200404)** ties its roadmap to both user-requested features and internal development milestones, creating shared accountability with its community.
- **[Riot Games](https://toxigon.com/the-business-strategy-behind-riot-games-success)** measure sentiment and retention alongside downloads, giving them a holistic view of success and player impact.

Borrow what works, adapt what doesn’t, and don’t be afraid to mix it up in your playbook.

## :broom: A clear goal keeps things tidy

It can give you permission to say *no*. No to that last-minute feature add, that “can we just try a TikTok,” or the extra email that dilutes your message. Sometimes less is more (especially in marketing when you are already competing with a lot of noise).

So next time someone asks what your marketing goal is, resist the urge to say, “To get people excited.”

Instead, try:  
**“To increase new user signups by 10% from our developer segment over four weeks, using targeted landing pages and partner promotions.”**

It’s easy to hop on the hype train when a shiny new idea rolls in—believe me, I’ve bought a ticket more than once. But if you want to reach the right station, you need more than excitement—you need a map.

Think of it like planning a trip:

  -Your objective is the destination—where you want to end up.

  -The strategy is your route—how you’ll get there.

  -Tactics are your pit stops and turns—the specific actions along the way.

  -KPIs are your GPS—they tell you if you’re veering off course.

  -And your key results? That’s your arrival photo. Proof you made it.
