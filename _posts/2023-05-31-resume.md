### Interested in a marketing leader with over 12 years of experience in tech and gaming? Look no further, but please do read on. 
<br>
My experience has been focused on a variety of audiences in mostly B2B. I started my marketing career in semiconductors and have moved from hardware to software over the years. My approach to marketing is multi-faceted to achieve the maximum outcome through a creative lens that allows for less traditional, more disruptive means of driving results. 
<br>
<br>
I also have a keen focus in my career developing plans that incorporate diversity, equity, and inclusion to allow me to find the unique perspectives beyond my own to help growth in my campaigns as well as make key relationships with co-workers and business partners.
